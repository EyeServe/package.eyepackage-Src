=== ABOUT package.eyepackage-Src ===
The file entitled "package.eyepackage" is the base install behind EyeOS/oneye. After spending many hours trying to figure out where the base system was hidden, Kyomaru had found a link to the EyeOS wiki that explained what it was.

	"A .eyepackage file is basically a .tar.gz file renamed to eyepackage."
	-- http://wiki.eyeos.org/Eyepackage
	
With that information, we were easily able to change the file extension, extract, and view/edit the files within.

We are assuming we weren't the only developers who had issues with this, maybe we were. Regardless, it's helpful knowledge for anyone trying to modify the system.
